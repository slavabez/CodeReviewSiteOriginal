Business Programming CW2
==============

Still in early development, no executable files here.

This project is my Business Programming coursework for the Spring Term of 2013. The end product should be an application that supports Users and Admins.
Users can upload code snipplets as HTML text, as well as review and comment on other people's Code Snipplets. 
Admins have acces to a wider array of functions, such as delete Code Snipplets, add/delete Users, etc.
